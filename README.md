# Neuroplasticity and Corruption in Model Mechanisms: A Case Study Of Indirect Object Identification

Current first iteration of the code the paper titled above. The code is extremely janky and was written for mech interp on google colab. It is a quick and dirty method to reproduce the main results of the paper. We have also linked the datasets that we created to use for fine-tuning and the fine-tuning scripts. Circuit discovery is done in IOIFullCircuit.ipynb and IOICrossModel for cross model activation patching. The dependencies are listed in each colab notebook. We will release a more readable and easily reproducible version of the code soon, including experiments on the greater-than-circuit found in the appendix.
